# Useful-Power-BI-queries
This repository contains a collection of useful Power BI queries, including both Power Query transformations and M code. These queries are ones I frequently use across various projects, and I'm saving them here for future reference and reuse.

Added calendar_table on the 8th of november 2024, this is a query that generates a calendar table in power BI in m code.
